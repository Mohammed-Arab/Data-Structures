• How did the three data structures compare in your tests?
the Robin Hood and the hash table are greatly faster than the sorted array.

• Is any significantly faster than the other?
yes for my test's the robin hood and simple hash table where faster significantly faster than the array.

• Does the Robin Hood hashing improve on the basic hash table?
a little bit.

• Did you expect the results that occurred? Why?
yes, because when we did the analysis of the functions in class sorted array was the worst

• What do you predict the results would be if you increased the database size to two million?
it will run faster in robin hood than the other two because it should run faster in larger databases.
