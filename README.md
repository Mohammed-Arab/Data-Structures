# Data-Structures
In our project, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of three different data structures: Robin Hood hashing, a basic hash table, and a sorted array. The results of our tests revealed that both Robin Hood hashing and the simple hash table significantly outperformed the sorted array in terms of speed and efficiency.
